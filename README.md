# 🛍️ AI-Driven Online Retail Customer Intelligence System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end Machine Learning workflow** using a real-world **Online Retail transactional dataset**.  
The same dataset is used to implement:

- ✅ **Unsupervised Learning** (Customer Segmentation)


The project focuses on extracting **business insights**, predicting **high-value customers**, and comparing **traditional ML models with Deep Learning**, following industry best practices.

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Initial inspection using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing value analysis
- Quantity and unit price distribution
- Country-wise sales analysis
- Time-based (monthly) sales trends
- Identification of outliers and returns

---

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed missing `CustomerID`
- Removed negative quantities (product returns)
- Removed zero or negative prices
- Created `TotalPrice = Quantity × UnitPrice`
- Removed duplicate records

---

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering – RFM Analysis
Created customer-level features:
- **Recency:** Days since last purchase
- **Frequency:** Number of invoices per customer
- **Monetary:** Total spending per customer

---

### 5️⃣ Unsupervised Learning – Customer Segmentation
- Algorithm used: **KMeans Clustering**
- Optimal number of clusters selected using:
  - Elbow Method

#### Customer Segments Identified
| Segment | Description |
|------|------------|
| High-Value Customers | Frequent, recent, high spenders |
| Regular Customers | Moderate engagement and spending |
| At-Risk Customers | Infrequent purchases, low spending |
